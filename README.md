2. Process
3. Conclusion

**Background**
- Why I'm doing this: I want to practice and enhance my SQL skills and explore the landscape of nuclear reactors around the world. This project will allow me to master SQL queries and comprehend the scope of nuclear reactors around the world
- Why I'm interested in nuclear energy: I beleive that understanding nuclear reactors now will allow me to be positioned greatly for the future search of clean and reliable energy. 
- Why I'm interested in SQL: Using SQL will allow me to leverage mass amounts of important data to make intelligent desicions for my personal, professional, and general interest topics such as nuclear energy, healthcare, technology, financial markets, and many other applications that will fuel my life.

**Major Topics Addressed**
- What are the major demographics and industry leaders for nuclear power since 1954?
- How good is the operational performance and efficiency for current nuclear reactors around the world?
- What is the historical development of nuclear reactors and how does it influence future energy sources?

- Tables:
  * Operational Reactors (MAIN TABLE) - Shows the current reactors in operation with country, name, reactor type, model, energy capacity, connection date. Connects with operators, suppliers, fuel, coolant, and type.
  * Coolants : Links with operational reactors and shows the coolants associated with a specefic reactor.
  * Fuel Info : Links with operational reactors and shows the fuels associated with a specefic reactor.
  * NSSS Suppliers : Links with operational reactors and shows the suppliers associated with a specefic reactor.
  * Operator : Links with operational reactors and shows the operators associated with a specefic reactor.
  * Reactor Types : Links with operational reactors and shows the reactor type associated with a specefic reactor.

  * Annual Summary Year (MAIN TABLE) - Shows the year, connection date, commercial operation date, energy ammount for connection, and energy ammount for commercial operation date

  * All Reactors (MAIN TABLE) - Shows everything in operational reactors table and includes shutdown reactors and construction dates.
